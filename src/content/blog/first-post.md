Set up an AWS account so I could use their cloud services to host and manage my website and other resources easily.

Created a Cloudflare account to take care of DNS and boost my site’s speed and security by using their network.

Bought a domain name that fits the brand and gives the website a unique, easy-to-remember address.

Built and launched an Astro website to have a super fast, modern site that’s easy to update and looks great.

Set up a Global Connect site to make sure people from all over the world can access the site quickly without delays.

Wrote and published a second blog post to add more content, keep things fresh, and give visitors a reason to come back.
